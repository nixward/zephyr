      GPIO connected to the RESET pin of the Quectel L96 GNSS module.
      - Drive low for at least 10ms to reset the module.
      - Drive high (or release if open-drain) to complete the reset cycle.
      Volatile RAM data may be lost, but backup RAM is retained,
      allowing faster time to first fix (TTFF) after reset.

      Cutting off VCC and keeping V_BCKP powered will make the
      module enter into backup mode from full on mode. As long as
      the VCC pin is powered, the module will enter into full on
      mode immediately.
